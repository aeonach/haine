project-details: This was the proprietor’s first shop. The existing unit on two floors was in need of complete renovation; the Client wished to turn it into a café at ground level but for the basement to be converted into a commercial kitchen for the production of their specialty cakes.<p> As their company was a very young enterprise their budget was limited. However, they needed to create a unique interior for the café as well as a functional and clean kitchen to meet all current regulations.</p>
