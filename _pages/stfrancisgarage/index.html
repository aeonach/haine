project-details: Fourteen years after the initial project, the Client wished to introduce more natural light into the hall – this necessitated the removal of the 5th bedroom to make way for a large lantern rooflight so an extension was designed to replace it.<p> This bedroom became a small housekeepers/guest apartment. It’s location to the side of the main 1920’s house within a wooded area of the garden suggested a timber clad building to compliment it’s location whilst being radically different to the main Art Deco house.</p>
