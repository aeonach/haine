project-details: The Client purchased this terraced house which was in reasonable condition but had an inadequate kitchen for the status and size of the house. We obtained planning permission for a fully glazed side extension which required the removal of the complete loadbearing side wall of the existing extension. A custom made hand painted kitchen was fabricated and new sliding folding doors fitted into new openings in the rear of the house. The remainder of the house was refurbished including new master bathroom, dressing room, joinery, two other new bathrooms, full redecoration, services, hardwood flooring as well as landscaping of front and rear gardens.
