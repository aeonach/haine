project-details: Having lived in the house for 20 years, the Client decided to knock the main basement rooms together to form a full length kitchen and dining room with a new utility room, cloakroom and storage rooms incorporated.<p> Following a close and detailed brief from the Client we designed a functional and traditional kitchen that was hand made by our specialist joiner.
