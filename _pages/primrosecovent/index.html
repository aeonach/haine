project-details: We designed and managed the opening of the first Primrose Bakery in 2006; the proprietors wished to continue to expand their brand; we looked at a number of sites for them and carried out feasibility studies.<p> In 2008 they found this site in the heart of Covent Garden â€“ all permissions were obtained and the space was totally fitted out in a 7 week period. The ground and basement floors were completely empty and needed fully fitting out. The basement was converted into a working bakery and kitchen, office and storage. The ground floor was fitted out with a small kitchen, display areas, banquette seating and a WC. The exterior was decorated in branded colours and a branded canopy fitted.</p>
