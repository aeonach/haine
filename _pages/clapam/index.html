project-details: The Client purchased this house in semi-derelict condition despite it being a good sized house in an ideal location next to the park.<p> It required total refurbishment including basement, roof and rear extensions that effectively increased itâ€™s internal area by a half, resulting in a 6 bedroom 4 bathroom house.</p> <p> The specification allowed a very high level of finish with extensive use of natural stone, hardwoods and high quality tiling and joinery.</p>
