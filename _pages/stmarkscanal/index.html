project-details: The Client sold their terraced family home of 30 years and bought a semi-derelict garden maisonette opposite on the canal. The flat had been gutted by a developer who was unable to deliver a finished project to the market so our Client purchased the shell from them.<p> We obtained planning permission for a rear extension and extensive roof terrace at raised ground floor level overlooking the canal. The interior of the flat had no plaster on the walls, no doors, no services and in places no floor. We refurbished the whole flat provided new windows and doors throughout, a fire rated screen to open out the kitchen and reception rooms, a new hand built Parapan kitchen with stainless steel worktop, new floors, joinery, bathrooms, cloakroom and complete services throughout.</p><p> The flat was also completely decorated inside and out and the front patio and rear garden were re-landscaped; we also designed and built a jetty onto the canal.</p>
