project-details: The Client had lived in the ground floor flat of this villa for a few years when they purchased the basement flat and we obtained planning permission to amalgamate the flats into a single duplex garden apartment.<p> This involved considerable structural work to open up the living accommodation on the ground floor and the lower floor was reconfigured into bedroom and bathroom accommodation. A feature staircase was fabricated along with new bathrooms, kitchen, wardrobes, joinery, TV and music systems.</p> <p>The original brick barrel vaulted soffites were renovated and exposed. </p>
