project-details: Our retired Client purchased this apartment on the top floor of a period mansion block overlooking Lords cricket ground which was in need of complete refurbishment.</p>
                            <p>All formal permissions were obtained including a complex Licence agreement and a total remodelling was completed including the provision of 3 new bathrooms, new kitchen, hardwood flooring, full decoration as well as some reorganisation of internal walls and room sizes.</p>
                            <p>The biggest challenge was the complete replacement of the services along with the introduction of water cooled air conditioning to some rooms. As the drainage, hot and cold water and electrical services are all provided from a communal supply, careful and research was needed to ensure the successful completion of the project.</p>
