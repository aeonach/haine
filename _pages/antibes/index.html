project-details: This small but perfectly formed villa sits in a quiet back street only moments from the beach â€“ our Client had owned it for over 30 years, using it every summer barely undertaking even the most basic maintenance.</p>
                            <p>Having retired they decided to carry out all essential maintenance particularly the complete overhaul of the external fabric, roofs etc. and to refurbish most of the interior of the house. This involved some major changes to internal walls and doors, a new kitchen, bathroom and decoration.</p>
                            <p>Drainage and landscaping was improved as well as repairs to subsidence damage to the external stairs, terrace and portico.</p>
