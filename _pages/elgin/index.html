project-details: The Client asked us to design and project manage the full refurbishment of their newly purchased terraced house as well as to obtain planning permission for a full width rear extension with raised ground floor balcony.<p> It was also necessary to slightly lower the basement level to improve headroom. The ground and 1st floors were also radically altered. A custom made Corian kitchen was sourced from a specialist joiner and extensive wardrobes, cupboards, shelving and other joinery items commissioned from specialists.</p>
