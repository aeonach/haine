project-details: We had undertaken some minor internal refurbishments to this beautiful early Victorian detached villa for the Client when they purchased it several years ago.</p>
                            <p>They always intended to improve the ugly rear extensions which blocked the views of the enormous rear gardens, so we obtained planning permission to demolish them completely. However, it was subsequently decided that this dramatic intervention was wasteful and a respectable outcome could be achieved by utilising the existing structures.</p>
                            <p>Some parts of the buildings were removed and large new door/window openings formed to introduce some order and formality to the elevations which had the effect of connecting the interior of the rear areas of the ground and 1st floors with the exterior.</p>
