project-details: Our Client downsized to this comfortable 4 bedroomed terrace which required a complete refurbishment and extension. We obtained planning, building regulation and party wall permissions and the full refurbishment was completed within 6 months.</p> 
                            <p>The works involved the demolition of the existing rear extension and its replacement with a traditional Victorian conservatory, considerable structural works, new kitchen, bathrooms, high quality oak floors throughout, joinery, wardrobes and bookshelves to all rooms as well as the integration of many of the Clientâ€™s traditional lights, fittings and features.</p> 
                            <p>During the works it was decided to replace the whole of the roof coverings as well as the rebuilding of a cantilevered feature window at 2nd floor level.</p>
