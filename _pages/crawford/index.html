project-details: This was an unusual project for us being a commercial project. Our Landlord owned a multitude of properties on which we were used to providing occasional advice but this project was adjacent to our offices so they asked us to obtain all necessary permissions to rebuild the lower two floors to provide high quality office accommodation including a retail unit facing the street.</p>
                            <p>We designed internal layouts to satisfy the Clientâ€™s requirements maximising the floor space whilst also meeting awkward fire and building regulations. The new roofs were installed as green roofs and internal access on each floor was provided to some outside space.</p>
