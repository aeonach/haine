project-details: The Client purchased this semi-detached house which was in very poor condition having been neglected for several decades.<p> We obtained planning permission to extend the house into the loft including three large rear dormers and rooflights to the front, to create a large bedroom, bathroom and dressing room plus rear extensions and alterations to bring the existing garage into the habitable space. This created a large open plan sitting, dining and kitchen whilst maintaining a more formal sitting room.</p><p> The existing bathrooms and cloakroom were refurbished, a handmade kitchen fabricated, new joinery throughout the house, complete new services, hardwood floors, sliding folding doors etc.</p><p> The whole house was redecorated inside and out and the front and rear gardens re-landscaped.</p>
