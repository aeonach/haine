project-details: This large end of terrace maisonette needed complete refurbishment when the Clientâ€™s bought it in 2002; the main exercise involved lowering the basement floor to achieve reasonable head height, demolition of main supporting walls, damp proofing, new slab and polished concrete floors, new services, and kitchen.<p> Over several further phases, we have refurbished three bathrooms, formed a basement laundry room with bespoke joinery, demolished an existing lean-to galley kitchen and store to convert into a double height master bathroom, altered the garden access and undertaken general ongoing maintenance.</p>
