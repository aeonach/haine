project-details: The Client had lived in this 5 bedroom duplex apartment for a few years having previously amalgamated two flats into one. The lower level however, under-utilised the large extension overlooking the garden.<p> We redesigned the whole of the garden level and commissioned Roundhouse to provide a new kitchen within the garden room. We designed dressers and other joinery to compliment the kitchen plus new cupboards, wardrobes, decoration and services throughout. The family bathroom was refurbished with marble wall and floor tiles.</p><p> The existing roof terrace was taken down and rebuilt to incorporate walk on rooflights and flush timber decking. The old kitchen was converted into a library and media room with bespoke walnut shelving, storage, bench and TV/music hub. </p>
