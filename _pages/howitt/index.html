project-details: The Client had lived in the house since we refurbished it in 2000 but with a growing family needed more space.<p> Rather than move house they decided to extend into a basement excavated below the whole footprint of the house and part of the garden. A large lightwell was installed to the rear and a new glass and oak stair connecting the new open plan kitchen and dining area to the ground floor reception rooms.</p><p> The existing rear ground floor extension was altered to form a linking hall/landing and stair with sliding doors, windows and rooflights flooding the new basement with natural light. The basement accommodation includes cloakroom, laundry, chilled wine cellar, bedroom and bathroom as well as a large open plan kitchen, dining area and study opening into a lightwell.</p>
