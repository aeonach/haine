project-details: Our Client purchased this elegant semi-detached 1930â€™s house and instructed us to refurbish it as a comfortable family house for her and her three small daughters.</p> 
                            <p>The house had been altered enormously from its original layout with inefficient use of stairs and landings and rooms leading off other rooms. We obtained planning, building regulation and party wall permissions for an extensive rear extensions as well as considerable structural work to open up the new extension to the main reception rooms of the house to form an enormous open plan living, eating and cooking area. Separate to this we formed an elegant reception room, large laundry, cloakroom and study, all with renovated Victorian tiles or new parquet flooring. Upstairs we reconfigured the middle floor into 4 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms and the top floor into a huge ensuite master bedroom with terrace and walk in dressing room.</p> 
                            <p>Throughout the house we built extensive joinery, bookshelves, wardrobes, storage as well as complete rewiring, plumbing, heating and AV including two TV systems.</p>
