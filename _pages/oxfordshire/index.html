project-details: This Grade 2 listed thatched house with 2 acres of land was in very poor condition when the Client purchased it.<p> We identified that the thatch and original elm roof timbers were too badly damaged to save and obtained Listed Consent to make considerable repair and improvements to the house without losing its charm and integrity.</p><p> Planning permission for additional dormers was obtained, the ceilings were removed in the upper floor to give the principle bedrooms vaulted ceilings, bathrooms and kitchen were renewed. All services were replaced and a swimming pool was also built within the grounds, heated via an air heat pump.</p>
