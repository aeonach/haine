project-details: We completed the general refurbishment and extension of this property in 2013 which the Client then decided to extend into the basement to accommodate their growing family.</p> 
                           <p> Complex party wall negotiations were needed as was planning and building regulation permissions before a full competitive tender process was completed. A specialist basement builder was employed who was retained on completion of the dig to carry out the fitting out of the new space into a bedroom suite, additional shower room/cloakroom, large playroom, storage plus a considerable new area of cupboarding, wine storage etc.</p> 
                           <p>Landsaping and lightwells front and back completed a considerable enlargement and improvement to this terraced house.</p>
