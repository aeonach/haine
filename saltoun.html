project-details: Our Client purchased this semi derelict mid terraced house with a view to return it to its former glory as a 5 bedroomed family home. It had illegally been in multiple occupation so required total rebuilding internally along with the construction of an infill extension which required considerable structural alterations and foundations.</p> 
                            <p>The top floor was remodelled completely including the removal of the internal ceilings and the introduction of Conservation grade rooflights. All internal staircases were removed and replaced with traditional balustrades and handrails, the hall was tiled with traditional ceramic designs, a high end German kitchen installed, four new bathrooms, a complete new heating, plumbing, electrical, lighting and AV systems installed as well as new fireplaces, wood burning stoves, laundry and TV room.</p> 
                            <p>The rear garden offered a considerable challenge as it required the removal of a massive metal shed, concrete slabs, foxes dens and collapsed walls and fences; replaced by a landscaped garden, rear terrace and a bespoke metal verandah.</p>
